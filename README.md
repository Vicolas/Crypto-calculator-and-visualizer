This crypto price calculator allows you to calculate the price of a cryptocurrency in another currency. 

Typically, the calculator takes in the current market price of the cryptocurrency and allows you to input the desired currency you want to convert to, such as USD in this case. The calculator calculates the current exchange rate and provides you with the price of the cryptocurrency in USD.

Below the calculator is a crypto dashboard that visualizes the daily closing prices of 5 distinct cryptocurrencies over a given period of time, such as a month, quarter, or year. 

The chart is designed to show the closing prices in a bar chart. You can interact with the chart by zooming in or out, selecting a specific time period, or hovering over a data point to see more information.

Overall, this crypto dashboard is a valuable tool for anyone interested in tracking the performance of cryptocurrencies and staying up-to-date with the latest market trends.
